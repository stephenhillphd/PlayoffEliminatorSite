Here we provide a look at the bracket as it currently stands (given the most recent CFP rankings). 

The CFP features 12 teams. Five spots in the playoff are awarded to the five highest ranked conference champions. This will typically be the Power Four (ACC, Big 10, Big 12, and SEC) conference champions plus the highest ranked Group of Five conference champion. However, it's important to note that no conference has a designated automatic bid! For example, if two Group of Five champions are among the top five conference champions, they would push out one of the Power Four champions. 

For the 2025 playoff teams are "straight-seeded" from 1 to 12. The 5, 6, 7, and 8 seeds host First Round playoff games on campus. The remainder of the games are hosted at traditional bowl sites.
