    "section": "",
    "text": "Here we provide a weekly description of the thought process behind any playoff eliminations.\nFinal\nNorth Texas, Virginia, BYU, Notre Dame\n(4 Teams Eliminated, 12 Teams Remain)\nWell, here we are! The College Football Playoff bracket has been announced and we’ve performed our final eliminations. I’ll leave it to the pundits to hash out the “fairness” and/or “correctness” of the final bracket. Check out our new article on the Articles page to see how the bracket would have looked under the BCS, the four team CFP, and hypothetical 16 and 24 team brackets.\nWeek 14\nArizona State, Georgia Tech, Michigan, Pittsburgh, San Diego State, SMU, Texas, Utah, Vanderbilt, Navy, USC\n(11 Teams Eliminated, 16 Teams Remain)\nWith the release of this week’s CFP rankings we have some clarity as to the playoff field. Realistically Georgia, Indiana, Ohio State, Oklahoma, Ole Miss, Oregon, Texas A&M, and Texas Tech are effectively locks for the playoff regardless of the results of this week’s conference championship games. That leaves eight teams fighting for the last four spots. Alabama should feel pretty good about its situation and is likely “in” barring a disaster against Georgia. There is potential for some “chaos” if Duke wins the ACC Championship. This would open the door for two Group of Five conference champions to enter the field.\nWeek 13\nCincinnati, Houston\n(2 Teams Eliminated, 27 Teams Remain)\nA consequence of our new reality of large conferences is scheduling that doesn’t necessarily involve the top teams in a conference playing each other each season. This can lead to tricky tiebreakers at the end of the season. That’s where find ourselves, particularly in the ACC. We’ll have a lot more clarity after this weekend.\nWeek 12\nSouth Florida, Baylor, Arizona, California, Duke, Illinois, Iowa, Iowa State, Louisville, LSU, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nebraska, NC State, Northwestern, Tennessee, TCU, Wake Forest, Washington\n(19 Teams Eliminated, 2 Teams Restored, 29 Teams Remain)\nSouth Florida’s stay in the land of the restored teams did not last long. A loss to Navy eliminates USF again. The CFP committee’s rankings for this week give Tulane the Group of Five spot, so we’ll restore them from prior elimination. We’ll also restore Navy as it looks like the Group of Five race is down to four teams: Tulane, North Texas, James Madison, and Navy. It’s also possible that San Diego State is lurking just on the fringes. JMU is the only 1-loss team in this group, but has yet to be ranked by the CFP committee. On the Power Four front, we are at a place where we start to eliminate teams even if they win. For example, Arizona won this week, but is eliminated from Big 12 Championship contention.\nWeek 11\nFlorida State, Kansas, Maryland, Memphis, Mississippi State, Navy, UCF\n(7 Teams Eliminated, 1 Team Restored, 46 Teams Remain)\nIt’s my goal to never have to “restore” an eliminated team, but here we are. Welcome back to South Florida. Their spot in this week’s CFP rankings is enough to raise them from the dead. For others, the news is less happy. Memphis is eliminated just one week after appearing in the projected CFP field.\nWeek 10\nAuburn, Clemson, Florida, Kansas State, Penn State, Rutgers, South Florida, Tulane, UNLV\n(9 Teams Eliminated, 52 Teams Remain)\nMore Power Four conference teams picked up their fifth loss this week. We also lost three more Group of Five teams. Memphis is the driver’s seat for the Group of Five CFP bid, but several others remain in the hunt. See our new “Bracket” page for a look at the “current” bracket based on the most recent CFP Rankings.\nWeek 9\nColorado, Kentucky, Michigan State, North Carolina, South Carolina, Stanford, Syracuse, UCLA\n(8 Teams Eliminated, 61 Teams Remain)\nThe culling of bottom-of-the-barrel Power Four conference teams continues this week. At this moment, five losses is enough to condemn these teams even if they were to miraculously win their conference. At that point, it’s quite likely that two Group of Five conference champions would rank above them.\nWeek 8\nArkansas, Boston College, Oklahoma State, Purdue, Virginia Tech, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Western Kentucky\n(8 Teams Eliminated, 69 Teams Remain)\nIt’s time. Several Power Four conference teams have accumulated enough losses that they are eliminated from CFP contention. These teams have been eliminated from at-large selection for several weeks, but now they are in positions where, even if they won their conference title, they would likely not be in the top five conference champions.\nWeek 7\nOld Dominion, Louisiana Tech, Fresno State\n(3 Teams Eliminated, 77 Teams Remain)\nThree more Group of Five teams are eliminated this week. Only nine Group of Five teams remain in the CFP hunt: Tulane, South Florida, North Texas, Navy, Memphis (AAC), Western Kentucky (CUSA), San Diego State, UNLV (MWC), and James Madison (SBC).\nWeek 6\nBoise State, Delaware, UL Monroe, New Mexico, Texas State\n(5 Teams Eliminated, 80 Teams Remain)\nWe’re down five more Group of Five teams this week. I admit that I hesitated a bit on Boise State. Would a two-loss Boise that beats (likely) UNLV twice and wins the Mountain West be able to sneak into the CFP as the fifth best conference champion? Possibly. The same scenario nearly played out last year with UNLV (had they beaten Boise in the MWC Championship Game).\nWeek 5\nAppalachian State, New Mexico State, Rice, Utah State\n(4 Teams Eliminated, 85 Teams Remain)\nIt was a relatively quiet week this week that saw the elimination of four more Group of Five teams. We inch closer to eliminating Power Four conference teams that are starting to rack up losses.\nWeek 4\nAir Force, Army, Bowling Green, Buffalo, Colorado State, East Carolina, Florida International, Hawaii, Northern Illinois, Oregon State, Southern Miss, Temple, Toledo, UAB, Washington State, Wyoming\n(16 Teams Eliminated, 89 Teams Remain)\nMore of our Group of Five friends head to the exit as they are eliminated from CFP contention. We also bid farewell to the lone holdouts from the former Pac-12 (Oregon State and Washington State). There are several Power Four conference teams that are in deep trouble (here’s looking at you Clemson, Virginia Tech, etc.). They’ll hold on for a little bit longer.\nWeek 3\nTulsa, Florida Atlantic, Jacksonville State, Liberty, Missouri State, UTEP, UConn, Kent State, Central Michigan, Ohio, Nevada, Coastal Carolina, Arkansas State, Louisiana, South Alabama, Troy\n(16 Teams Eliminated, 105 Teams Remain)\nAnother rough week for our friends in Group of Five conferences as we say say “Goodbye” to 15 G5 teams. We’re almost done to under 100 teams with some (even very small) shot at CFP participation. We are getting really close to several Power Four conference teams joining this infamous list.\nWeek 2\nCharlotte, UTSA, Kennesaw State, Middle Tennessee, Ball State, Eastern Michigan, Massachusetts, Miami (OH), Western Michigan, San José State, Georgia Southern, Georgia State, Marshall\n(15 Teams Eliminated, 121 Teams Remain)\nThis week we bid farewell to the CFP hopes of 13 more teams. All of these teams are teams are Group of Five conference teams that picked up their second losses (and project to likely pick up many more). We are down to 121 teams with at least a glimmer of hope for a path to the CFP. A quick note on Oregon State and Washington State: These two teams are (until next season) the last holdouts from the Pac-12 Conference. Practically speaking, they are more like “Independent” teams than they are members of a real conference. I’ll be treating them as teams that have a status somewhere between Notre Dame (treated as a Power Four team) and the Group of Five conference teams. Oregon State’s two bad losses to start 2025 puts them in a particularly precarious situation. One more loss should be enough to eliminate them.\nWeeks 0 and 1\nSam Houston\n(2 Teams Eliminated, 134 Teams Remain)\nSam Houston State takes the honor of being the first team in the FBS with two losses and joins Akron. Further eliminations will commence in Week 2.\nPreseason 2025\nAkron \n(1 Team Eliminated, 135 Teams Remain)\nEach week we’ll update the graphic on the home page to reflect the “elimination” of teams from the College Football Playoff (CFP) race. Akron is ineligible for the postseason due to a low Academic Progress Rate. So we start the season with 135 teams in the CFP race.\nI was ready to eliminate Delaware and Missouri State (the newest members of the Football Bowl Subdivision) as new teams are typically ineligible for the postseason (with some exceptions) due to their transition period. However, Delaware and Missouri State are bowl-eligible if there are not enough teams available to fill the available bowl slots. The problem is that both teams are not eligible to win the Conference USA title. This precludes them from being a potential automatic CFP qualifier.\nRecall that CFP spots are available to the five highest-ranked conference champions. Presumably, this will be the four power conference champions (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, and SEC) plus the highest ranked Group of Five champion. This means that Delaware and Missouri State’s only path (highly implausible, but not completely impossible) is to be selected as one of the seven at-large teams. We’ll these teams as “not eliminated” team for the moment, but a single loss will be enough to remove them from contention. In short, I’ll eat the laptop I’m typing this on if either of these teams makes the CFP."

Five spots in the playoff are awarded to the five highest ranked conference champions. This will typically be the Power Four (ACC, Big 10, Big 12, and SEC) conference champions plus the highest ranked Group of Five conference champion. However, it’s important to note that no conference has a designated automatic bid! For example, if two Group of Five champions are among the top five conference champions, they would push out one of the Power Four champions.\nFor the 2025 playoff teams are “straight-seeded” from 1 to 12. The 5, 6, 7, and 8 seeds host First Round playoff games on campus. The remainder of the games are hosted at traditional bowl sites."

    "text": "CFP Simulation (Before First Round)\nAs we did last year, we simulated the CFP using Monte Carlo simulation with win probabilities for each potential match-up derived from the Massey Ratings (https://masseyratings.com/). Massey’s ratings have looked favorably on Ohio State all season and this translates to the Buckeyes having the highest probability to win the National Championship. We’ll update these projections as the playoff unfolds.\n\n\nHypothetical Brackets\nFor our first article we take a look at hypotheticsl CFP brackets for 2025. Let’s take a look at how the BCS (2 teams), four team CFP, and hypothetical 16 and 24 teams playoffs would look. We use the CPF rankings to seed the teams. For the 24 team bracket, we use the PEAR Ratings (https://pearatings.com/cfb/fbs) to seed the conference champions that are outside of the CFP Top 25.\nBCS: 2 Teams\nThe Bowl Championship Series matched the top two ranked teams using a rating system comprised of comptuer and human polls. No auto-bids. The BCS was used from 1998 through 2013 and was not without its detractors and controversies. No Group of Five team was ever realistically close to inclusion in the BCS championship game. For 2025, the BCS would yield a re-match of Indiana and Ohio State.\nOriginal CFP: 4 Teams\nThe CFP with four teams (no auto bids) began in 2014 and ended in 2023. Only one Group of Five team (Cincinnati in 2021) every made the playoff in this format.\n Modified CFP: 16 Teams\nFor this hypothetical bracket, we’ll assume that the automatics bids from the current CFP format (top five conference champions) remain the same. We just add four more at-large teams.\n\nModified CFP: 24 Teams\nThis hypothetical format is modeled after the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) playoff format. Each conference receives an automatic bid for their champion. The remaining teams are at-large. It seems likely that conference championship games would go away in this format."
