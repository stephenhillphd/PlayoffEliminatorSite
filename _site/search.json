    "text": "Welcome to the College Football Playoff Eliminator! Here we track our best guesses as to which teams have been eliminated from College Football Playoff (CFP) contention. We can make these guesses by leaning heavily on the history of the CFP selection process. In general, we can summarize the selection criteria with a few simple bullet points. In order to be in serious CFP contention your team needs to be:\n\nAn undefeated Power 5 conference (ACC, Big 10, Big 12, Pac-12 or SEC) champion\n\nNo undefeated Power 5 conference champion has been excluded from the CFP\n\nA one-loss Power 5 conference champion\n\nThree one-loss Power 5 champions have been excluded from the CFP since its inception is 2014. Two of those teams were from the Big 12 in 2014 (Baylor and TCU shared the Big 12 title and the conference did not hold a conference championship game). Ohio State was excluded in 2018. The Buckeyes’ one loss that season was a particularly ugly 49-20 beatdown by Purdue.\n\nAn undefeated Group of 5 (American, Conference USA, Mid-American, Mountain West, and Sun Belt)\n\nThere have been seven undefeated Group of 5 conference champions since the start of the playoff. Only one was selected for the CFP (Cincinnati in 2021). None of the others were particularly close to being selected, but there is still a glimmer of hope if your team goes undefeated and can manage a couple of wins against Power 5 opposition along the way.\n\n\nNo two-loss team (Power 5 or otherwise; conference champion or otherwise) has ever been selected for the CFP. Alabama came close in 2022, finishing 5th in the final CFP rankings.\nOf course, all of this will change with the implementation of the 12-team CFP in 2024. Until then, let’s weep or cheer as our team or our rival has their hopes of CFP glory dashed."

    "text": "September 16, 2023 (Week 3)\n(19 Teams Eliminated, 74 Total Eliminated)\nJust three weeks in and over half of the teams in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) have seen their dreams of a National Championship thrown into the dumpster. This is the week where we start to see Power Five teams fall by the wayside. The trickiest part of this process is determining what to do with two-loss Power Five teams. The College Football Playoff has never has never had a two-loss team as a participant, but I’m convinced that a path for a two-loss team does exist. For example, if the 2022 Alabama team (two close losses to Tennessee and LSU) had been able to win the SEC West and then defeat Georgia in the SEC title game, they would have had a very compelling case for inclusion in the playoff. Are there teams in 2023 that could fit the very narrow profile of a two-loss playoff contender? Possibly. South Carolina seems like an interesting case as the (perhaps) best two-loss team in the country at this point. If they ran the table and made it into the SEC title game (would require at least two Georgia losses) they would be 10-2 with wins over Tennessee, Florida, Missouri, Texas A&M, and Clemson. Would an SEC title game win over an LSU or Alabama be enough? I’m not sure, but it seems like at least a remote possibility.\nBoston College, Colorado State, Georgia Southern, Georgia Tech, Houston, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa State, Louisiana Monroe, Northwestern, Oklahoma State, Pittsburgh, Purdue, Stanford, Texas Tech, Vanderbilt, Virginia, Western Kentucky, and Wyoming.\nNote: In hindsight, Boston College, Colorado State, Texas Tech, and Virginia probably should have been eliminated before this week due to losses to Group of Five teams.\n\n\nSeptember 9, 2023 (Week 2)\n(18 Teams Eliminated, 55 Total Eliminated)\nIt’s my goal with this to never have to “un-eliminate” a team. I spent a bit of time trying to figure out what to do with Baylor. Would they be the first Power 5 conference team to be eliminated? I’m going to say “yes”. The Bears sit at 0-2 with the loss to Texas State still looming large.\nUNLV, Southern Miss, Tulsa, Baylor, Troy, Appalachian State, SMU, Tulane, Western Michigan, Texas State, Northern Illinois, UAB, Florida Atlantic, Louisiana, Charlotte, Eastern Michigan, Temple, and San Diego State.\n\n\n\nSeptember 2, 2023 (Week 1)\n(26 Teams Eliminated, 37 Total Eliminated)\nThe pile of eliminated teams continues to grow this week. Kent State, UConn, Central Michigan, Miami (OH), East Carolina, Middle Tennessee, Nevada, Boise State, Rice, Buffalo, Arkansas State, New Mexico, South Alabama, Utah State, Ball State, Bowling Green, Louisiana Tech, Akron, UMass, South Florida, North Texas, Army, UTSA, Toledo, Old Dominion, and Coastal Carolina.\nIt was tempting to eliminate Baylor as a loss to Texas State is nearly unforgivable. If they ran the table and won the Big 12 would that be enough to overcome this stinker of a loss?\n\n\n\nAugust 26, 2023 (Week 0)\n(7 Teams Eliminated, 11 Total Eliminated)\nThis week we say “good-bye” to: San Jose State, Navy, UTEP, New Mexico State, Ohio, FIU, and Hawaii. Gone, but not forgotten…\n\n\n\nPreseason 2023\n(4 Teams Eliminated, 4 Total Eliminated)\nEach week we’ll update the graphic on the home page to reflect the “elimination” of teams from the College Football Playoff (CFP) race. For four teams, the race was over before it even started. In late August, Arizona State announced that it was self-imposing a bowl ban for the 2023 season. Given how bad Arizona State has been in recent years, this hardly seems like punishment (were they going to make a bowl game anyway?). They start the season eliminated.\nThree teams are in transition from the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) to the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). James Madison is in its second and final year of this transition. There are some condition under which the Dukes could make a bowl game, but their journey to the 2023 CFP is over before it even has a chance to begin. Sam Houston State and Jacksonville State are in their first year of the transition process. They are also out of the CFP race."
