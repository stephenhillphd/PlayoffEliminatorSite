    "text": "Welcome to the College Football Playoff Eliminator! Beginning with the 2023 college football season, we have been tracking which teams have been eliminated from College Football Playoff (CFP) contention.\nThe 12 team playoff format will shake up the elimination process and completely re-write any “rules of thumb” that we could use to identify eliminated teams from four team playoff era. Join us as we venture into this new reality and do our best to eliminate the unworthy and retain teams that have a shot at postseason glory!\nThe 12 Team Playoff\nThe 12 team version of the CFP will be populated by teams via two methods:\n\nThe five highest ranked (in the CFP rankings) conference champions will receive entry into the CFP.\nThe next seven highest ranked teams will also receive bids to the CFP.\n\nThe top four conference champions will receive a first-round bye. The remaining eight teams will play in first round matchups at campus sites."

    "text": "Here we will provide a weekly description of the thought process behind any playoff eliminations.\nWeek 4\nEast Carolina, South Florida, Louisiana Tech, Ball State, Ohio, Bowling Green, Georgia Southern, Marshall, Appalachian State, Arkansas State\n(10 teams eliminated)\n(43 total eliminated)\n\nWe continue saying “Goodbye!” to a variety of Group of 4 teams that hit the two loss threshold. We are getting ever closer to being Power 4 teams joining the ranks of the eliminated. Once a Power 4 team falls far enough back to be eliminated from conference championship contention, we can safely cast them aside. For some teams (even pretty bad teams) this may take awhile.\nWeek 3\nRice, Tulane, Tulsa, UAB, UTSA, New Mexico State, Middle Tennessee, Florida International, UConn, Miami (OH), Central Michigan, Air Force, Colorado State, Hawai’i, San Diego State, Utah State, Southern Miss\n(17 teams eliminated)\n(33 total eliminated)\nThis week we bid farewell to another set of Group of 4 teams as they pass over the bridge to two losses. While these teams could, technically, still win their conference, it seems unlikely that there would not be a better Group of 4 champion ranked above them. What about three loss Power 4 teams (e.g., Florida State)? These teams have not been mathematically eliminated from conference championship contention. However, as these teams compile more and more losses it seems exceedingly likely that, even if they won their conference, that a Group of 4 conference champion could pass them. Recall that no conference (not even the SEC and Big Ten) have an automatic berth in the playoff. Rather, the top five conference champions (from any conference) gain automatic entry into the playoff.\n\nWeek 2\nCharlotte, Florida Atlantic, Temple, Jacksonville State, UTEP, Massachusetts, Akron, Kent State, Western Michigan, New Mexico, Wyoming, Nevada, Old Dominion, South Alabama, Troy\n(15 teams eliminated)\n(16 total eliminated)\nThe culling begins. It seems incredibly unlikely that the committee will award at-large bids to two loss non-Power 4 teams. Several teams hit this two loss threshold this week. UMass is an interesting case with both Missouri and Georgia left on the schedule. Would winning out and winning those two big games be enough? Probably not.\n\n\nWeeks 0 and 1\nKennesaw State \n(1 team eliminated)\n(1 total eliminated)\nThis week we say goodbye to the Football Subdivision’s newest member, Kennesaw State. As we noted in the Preseason analysis, Kennesaw is not eligible to win the Conference USA title. Their only path to the College Football Playoff would have been via an at-large berth (given to the top seven non-conference champions). The Owls Week 1 loss to UTSA ends those hopes.\nA few other teams are teetering on the edge of the precipice (I’m looking at you New Mexico, UMass, and UConn). One more loss for UMass and UConn should send them sliding over the edge.\n\n\nPreseason 2024\n(No Teams Eliminated)\nEach week we’ll update the graphic on the home page to reflect the “elimination” of teams from the College Football Playoff (CFP) race.\nI was ready to eliminate Kennesaw State (the newest member of the Football Bowl Subdivision) as new teams are typically ineligible for the postseason (with some exceptions) due to their transition period. While Kennesaw is bowl-eligible (if there are not enough teams available to fill the available bowl slots), Kennesaw is not eligible to win the Conference USA title. This precludes them from being a potential automatic CFP qualifier.\nCFP spots are available to the five highest-ranked conference champions. Presumably, this will be the four power conference champions (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, and SEC) plus the highest ranked Group of Five champion. Kennesaw State’s only path (highly implausible, but not completely impossible) is to be selected as one of the seven at-large teams. We’ll leave Kennesaw State as a “not eliminated” team for the moment, but a single loss will be enough to remove them from contention."

    "text": "2023 Season\nHere’s a look back at the 2023 season of the College Football Playoff Eliminator.\n\nDecember 2, 2023 (Week 13)\n(4 Team Eliminated, 129 Total Eliminated)\nThe 2023 College Football Playoff is here at last and not without its share of controversy. The theme of the 2023 season has been a relative lack of chaos as an unprecedented number of teams entered Conference Championship weekend with a shot at the playoff. Friday night saw Oregon fall for the second time this season to Washington, ending the Ducks’ playoff hopes. Saturday saw Alabama upset two-time, defending national champion Georgia. Michigan and Florida State both slogged through their respective conference championship games. That left Alabama, Georgia, Michigan, Ohio State, Texas, and Washington with realistic playoff ambitions entering Selection Sunday. The CFP Committee ultimately selected Michigan, Washington, Texas, and Alabama as the four playoff participants, leaving Florida State out in the cold as the first undefeated, Power 5 conference champion to be left out of the playoff. As an Alabama graduate and fan, I’m not too heartbroken over this.\nFlorida State, Georgia, Ohio State, and Oregon\n\n\nNovember 25, 2023 (Week 12)\n(1 Team Eliminated, 125 Total Eliminated)\nAlabama played with fire, but managed to escape Auburn with a dramatic win. Ohio State’s loss puts it in a precarious position, but a path the playoff probably still exists. We say good-bye to the Louisville. The Cardinals are no longer playoff contenders, but can shake-up the playoff picture with a win over Florida State in the ACC Championship Game.\nLouisville\n\n\nNovember 18, 2023 (Week 11)\n(0 Teams Eliminated, 124 Total Eliminated)\nFor the first time this season, no teams were eliminated as the trend of limited chaos continues.\n\n\nNovember 11, 2023 (Week 11)\n(2 Teams Eliminated, 124 Total Eliminated)\nTwo more teams are eliminated this week. We are down to the final nine teams that have at least some plausible shot at making the playoff. There has been relatively little chaos thus far this season. Will that continue or will we see our typical flurry of late season upsets that could throw the playoff picture into disarray?\nOle Miss and Penn State\n\n\nNovember 4, 2023 (Week 10)\n(5 Teams Eliminated, 122 Total Eliminated)\nThe potential playoff field continues to dwindle as a few big names fall out of the chase. Eleven teams remain with a viable path to the top four.\nAlthough Liberty remains undefeated, they did not appear in the first College Football Playoff (CFP) rankings. Even if they complete an undefeated season, their playoff hopes have come to an end. With Air Force’s loss, the Flames do have a shot at a New Year’s Six bowl appearance.\nAir Force, Liberty, Oklahoma, LSU, and Missouri\n\n\nOctober 28, 2023 (Week 9)\n(4 Teams Eliminated, 117 Total Eliminated)\nFour more teams encountered the end of their College Football Playoff (CFP) road this week. This upcoming week is a pivotal one as the CFP Selection Committee will release their first ranking on Tuesday. The release of this ranking may be enough to eliminate a few teams from CFP contention. Why? Well, no team ranked lower than 16th in the first CFP rankings has ever made the playoffs (Ohio State in 2014). Air Force may (barely) make the cut, but it seems unlikely that Liberty will rank in the top 16 (they may not even make the top 25). We’ll address these teams in the next update.\nOregon State, North Carolina, Utah, and Wisconsin\n\n\nOctober 21, 2023 (Week 8)\n(4 Teams Eliminated, 113 Total Eliminated)\nWe’re down to 20 teams! Our two Group of Five darlings remain alive this week in Air Force and Liberty. Air Force is comfortably in the Top 25 rankings and (as long as they keep winning) looking good for a spot in a New Year’s Six bowl. Liberty is getting little notice and remains outside of the Top 25.\nDuke, Iowa, Tennessee, and USC\n\n\nOctober 14, 2023 (Week 7)\n(9 Teams Eliminated, 109 Total Eliminated)\nThis week we move past the 100 team elimination mark. A total of 27 teams can make some claim (at least theoretically) to a path to a berth in College Football Playoff (CFP). Only two Group of Five teams remain: Air Force and Liberty. Realistically, these two teams are not likely to make an appearance in the CFP. It is more likely that they are contending for the Group of Five berth in the New Year’s Six bowls. One loss Tulane is also a contender for this berth, but has no conceivable path to the CFP.\nBYU, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Miami, Texas A&M, UCLA, West Virginia, and Washington State\n\n\nOctober 7, 2023 (Week 6)\n(7 Teams Eliminated, 100 Total Eliminated)\nOnly five teams are eliminated this week, but we are very close to the point in the season where we have to start being more realistic about the playoff chances of teams that are on the fringe of the playoff picture. We may eliminate teams that continue to win, but have no realistic hope of moving into the playoff discussion. This will become especially true when the first, official College Football Playoff rankings are released later in October.\nTwo of our Group of Five teams saw their (outside) chances of a playoff berth end with losses. Good-bye to Fresno State and Marshall.\nThis week, we bid farewell to two-loss Notre Dame. I was also close to eliminating Liberty this week after the Flames’ tepid win over Sam Houston State. On principle alone, I’m very tempted to dismiss Miami. They deserve it after their royal flub in end-game management.\nFresno State, Kansas State, Marshall, Notre Dame, Rutgers, Syracuse, and Wake Forest\n\n\nSeptember 30, 2023 (Week 5)\n(9 Teams Eliminated, 93 Total Eliminated)\nThis week we bid farewell to nine more teams with eight of victims being Power Five teams. Georgia State is only lone Group of Five squad to see the door slammed shut on its very narrow path to the College Football Playoff. Only four Group of Five teams remain in the conversation (admittedly their chances are extremely slim): Air Force, Fresno State, Liberty, and Marshall. Air Force and Fresno State do not meet in the regular season, but could both be undefeated heading to the Mountain West Championship Game. Fresno State continues to have the best resume out of the Group of Five teams with two wins over Power Five opponents.\nLSU took its second loss of the season at Ole Miss, but I’m leaving them in contention for now as they retain a viable path to the SEC Championship Game. They have no margin for error at this point.\nArizona, Auburn, Colorado, Florida, Georgia State, NC State, South Carolina, TCU, and UCF\n\n\nSeptember 23, 2023 (Week 4)\n(10 Teams Eliminated, 84 Total Eliminated)\nThe Power Five teams are starting to “drop like flies” as second losses start to pile up. This includes “Little Ole Clemson”. Once a CFP regular, the Tigers are staring down a four or five loss season. Alabama hangs on for another week. Colorado is holding on by a thread after their devastating loss at Oregon. A beat down at home to USC next week would end Coach Prime’s hopes of a CFP berth in his first year in Boulder. I probably should have eliminated Nebraska earlier. Their two losses don’t look great after a couple more weeks of play. Virginia Tech probably should have been eliminated earlier, but they are definitely gone now.\nTurning our attention to our friends from the Group of Five conferences, we see that only a handful of teams remain. We should probably be honest with ourselves about Group of Five teams at the moment. Fresno State is the highest ranked Group of Five team, just sneaking in to the AP Poll at Number 25 after this week’s games. That’s a lot of ground to make up to get to the Top 4. The Bulldogs have two wins over Power Five teams, but it’s hard to see a realistic path to the playoff. The playoff path for Georgia State, Liberty, and Marshall is even more narrow. We’ll keep these teams in until it becomes overwhelmingly obvious that they have no shot. Next year’s 12-team playoff guarantees access to the best Group of Five champion (yes, I’m already thinking about how to configure the Playoff Eliminator for next season).\nArkansas, California, Cincinnati, Clemson, Memphis, Michigan State, Minnesota, Mississippi State, Nebraska, and Virginia Tech\n\n\nSeptember 16, 2023 (Week 3)\n(19 Teams Eliminated, 74 Total Eliminated)\nJust three weeks in and over half of the teams in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) have seen their dreams of a National Championship thrown into the dumpster. This is the week where we start to see Power Five teams fall by the wayside. The trickiest part of this process is determining what to do with two-loss Power Five teams. The College Football Playoff has never has never had a two-loss team as a participant, but I’m convinced that a path for a two-loss team does exist. For example, if the 2022 Alabama team (two close losses to Tennessee and LSU) had been able to win the SEC West and then defeat Georgia in the SEC title game, they would have had a very compelling case for inclusion in the playoff. Are there teams in 2023 that could fit the very narrow profile of a two-loss playoff contender? Possibly. South Carolina seems like an interesting case as the (perhaps) best two-loss team in the country at this point. If they ran the table and made it into the SEC title game (would require at least two Georgia losses) they would be 10-2 with wins over Tennessee, Florida, Missouri, Texas A&M, and Clemson. Would an SEC title game win over an LSU or Alabama be enough? I’m not sure, but it seems like at least a remote possibility.\nBoston College, Colorado State, Georgia Southern, Georgia Tech, Houston, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa State, Louisiana Monroe, Northwestern, Oklahoma State, Pittsburgh, Purdue, Stanford, Texas Tech, Vanderbilt, Virginia, Western Kentucky, and Wyoming.\nNote: In hindsight, Boston College, Colorado State, Texas Tech, and Virginia probably should have been eliminated before this week due to losses to Group of Five teams.\n\n\nSeptember 9, 2023 (Week 2)\n(18 Teams Eliminated, 55 Total Eliminated)\nIt’s my goal with this to never have to “un-eliminate” a team. I spent a bit of time trying to figure out what to do with Baylor. Would they be the first Power 5 conference team to be eliminated? I’m going to say “yes”. The Bears sit at 0-2 with the loss to Texas State still looming large.\nUNLV, Southern Miss, Tulsa, Baylor, Troy, Appalachian State, SMU, Tulane, Western Michigan, Texas State, Northern Illinois, UAB, Florida Atlantic, Louisiana, Charlotte, Eastern Michigan, Temple, and San Diego State.\n\n\n\nSeptember 2, 2023 (Week 1)\n(26 Teams Eliminated, 37 Total Eliminated)\nThe pile of eliminated teams continues to grow this week. Kent State, UConn, Central Michigan, Miami (OH), East Carolina, Middle Tennessee, Nevada, Boise State, Rice, Buffalo, Arkansas State, New Mexico, South Alabama, Utah State, Ball State, Bowling Green, Louisiana Tech, Akron, UMass, South Florida, North Texas, Army, UTSA, Toledo, Old Dominion, and Coastal Carolina.\nIt was tempting to eliminate Baylor as a loss to Texas State is nearly unforgivable. If they ran the table and won the Big 12 would that be enough to overcome this stinker of a loss?\n\n\n\nAugust 26, 2023 (Week 0)\n(7 Teams Eliminated, 11 Total Eliminated)\nThis week we say “good-bye” to: San Jose State, Navy, UTEP, New Mexico State, Ohio, FIU, and Hawaii. Gone, but not forgotten…\n\n\n\nPreseason 2023\n(4 Teams Eliminated, 4 Total Eliminated)\nEach week we’ll update the graphic on the home page to reflect the “elimination” of teams from the College Football Playoff (CFP) race. For four teams, the race was over before it even started. In late August, Arizona State announced that it was self-imposing a bowl ban for the 2023 season. Given how bad Arizona State has been in recent years, this hardly seems like punishment (were they going to make a bowl game anyway?). They start the season eliminated.\nThree teams are in transition from the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) to the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). James Madison is in its second and final year of this transition. There are some condition under which the Dukes could make a bowl game, but their journey to the 2023 CFP is over before it even has a chance to begin. Sam Houston State and Jacksonville State are in their first year of the transition process. They are also out of the CFP race."
