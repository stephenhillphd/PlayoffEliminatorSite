Welcome to the College Football Playoff Eliminator! Beginning with the 2023 college football season, we have been tracking which teams have been eliminated from College Football Playoff (CFP) contention.

The 12 team playoff format will shake up the elimination process and completely re-write any "rules of thumb" that we could use to identify eliminated teams from four team playoff era. Join us as we venture into this new reality and do our best to eliminate the unworthy and retain teams that have a shot at postseason glory!

**The 12 Team Playoff**

The 12 team version of the CFP will be populated by teams via two methods:

* The five highest ranked (in the CFP rankings) conference champions will receive entry into the CFP.
* The next seven highest ranked teams will also receive bids to the CFP.

The top four conference champions will receive a first-round bye. The remaining eight teams will play in first round matchups at campus sites.
