title: "Weekly Analysis"

Here we will provide a weekly description of the thought process behind any playoff eliminations.

**Week 4**

*East Carolina, South Florida, Louisiana Tech, Ball State, Ohio, Bowling Green, Georgia Southern, Marshall, Appalachian State, Arkansas State\
*(10 teams eliminated)\
(43 total eliminated)\
\
We continue saying "Goodbye!" to a variety of Group of 4 teams that hit the two loss threshold. We are getting ever closer to being Power 4 teams joining the ranks of the eliminated. Once a Power 4 team falls far enough back to be eliminated from conference championship contention, we can safely cast them aside. For some teams (even pretty bad teams) this may take awhile.

**Week 3**

*Rice, Tulane, Tulsa, UAB, UTSA, New Mexico State, Middle Tennessee, Florida International, UConn, Miami (OH), Central Michigan, Air Force, Colorado State, Hawai'i, San Diego State, Utah State, Southern Miss\
*(17 teams eliminated)\
(33 total eliminated)

This week we bid farewell to another set of Group of 4 teams as they pass over the bridge to two losses. While these teams could, technically, still win their conference, it seems unlikely that there would not be a better Group of 4 champion ranked above them. What about three loss Power 4 teams (e.g., Florida State)? These teams have not been mathematically eliminated from conference championship contention. However, as these teams compile more and more losses it seems exceedingly likely that, even if they won their conference, that a Group of 4 conference champion could pass them. Recall that no conference (not even the SEC and Big Ten) have an automatic berth in the playoff. Rather, the top five conference champions (from any conference) gain automatic entry into the playoff.

#### Week 2

*Charlotte, Florida Atlantic, Temple, Jacksonville State, UTEP, Massachusetts, Akron, Kent State, Western Michigan, New Mexico, Wyoming, Nevada, Old Dominion, South Alabama, Troy*\
(15 teams eliminated)\
(16 total eliminated)

The culling begins. It seems incredibly unlikely that the committee will award at-large bids to two loss non-Power 4 teams. Several teams hit this two loss threshold this week. UMass is an interesting case with both Missouri and Georgia left on the schedule. Would winning out and winning those two big games be enough? Probably not.

#### Weeks 0 and 1

*Kennesaw State* *\
*(1 team eliminated)\
(1 total eliminated)

This week we say goodbye to the Football Subdivision's newest member, Kennesaw State. As we noted in the Preseason analysis, Kennesaw is not eligible to win the Conference USA title. Their only path to the College Football Playoff would have been via an at-large berth (given to the top seven non-conference champions). The Owls Week 1 loss to UTSA ends those hopes.

A few other teams are teetering on the edge of the precipice (I'm looking at you New Mexico, UMass, and UConn). One more loss for UMass and UConn should send them sliding over the edge.

#### Preseason 2024

*(No Teams Eliminated)*

Each week we'll update the graphic on the home page to reflect the "elimination" of teams from the College Football Playoff (CFP) race.

I was ready to eliminate Kennesaw State (the newest member of the Football Bowl Subdivision) as new teams are typically ineligible for the postseason (with some exceptions) due to their transition period. While Kennesaw is bowl-eligible (if there are not enough teams available to fill the available bowl slots), Kennesaw is not eligible to win the Conference USA title. This precludes them from being a potential automatic CFP qualifier.

CFP spots are available to the five highest-ranked conference champions. Presumably, this will be the four power conference champions (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, and SEC) plus the highest ranked Group of Five champion. Kennesaw State's only path (highly implausible, but not completely impossible) is to be selected as one of the seven at-large teams. We'll leave Kennesaw State as a "not eliminated" team for the moment, but a single loss will be enough to remove them from contention.
