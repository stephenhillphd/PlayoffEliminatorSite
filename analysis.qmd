title: "Weekly Analysis"

Here we will provide a weekly description of the thought process behind any playoff eliminations.

#### Preseason 2024

*(1 Team Eliminated, 1 Total Eliminated)*

Each week we'll update the graphic on the home page to reflect the "elimination" of teams from the College Football Playoff (CFP) race. For one team, the race is over before it even starts. **Kennesaw State** is the newest Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) team and is in a transition period from the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). Because of this transition, they would not be eligible for participation in the CFP.
