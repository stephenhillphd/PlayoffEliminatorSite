#### September 9, 2023 (Week 2)

*(18 Teams Eliminated, 55 Total Eliminated)*

It's my goal with this to never have to "un-eliminate" a team. I spent a bit of time trying to figure out what to do with Baylor. Would they be the first Power 5 conference team to be eliminated? I'm going to say "yes". The Bears sit at 0-2 with the loss to Texas State still looming large.

**UNLV**, **Southern Miss**, **Tulsa**, **Baylor**, **Troy**, **Appalachian State**, **SMU**, **Tulane**, **Western Michigan**, **Texas State**, **Northern Illinois**, **UAB**, **Florida Atlantic**, **Louisiana**, **Charlotte**, **Eastern Michigan**, **Temple**, and **San Diego State**.

#### September 2, 2023 (Week 1)

*(26 Teams Eliminated, 37 Total Eliminated)*

The pile of eliminated teams continues to grow this week. **Kent State**, **UConn**, **Central Michigan**, **Miami (OH)**, **East Carolina**, **Middle Tennessee**, **Nevada**, **Boise State**, **Rice**, **Buffalo**, **Arkansas State**, **New Mexico**, **South Alabama**, **Utah State**, **Ball State**, **Bowling Green**, **Louisiana Tech**, **Akron**, **UMass**, **South Florida**, **North Texas**, **Army**, **UTSA**, **Toledo**, **Old Dominion**, and **Coastal Carolina**.

It was tempting to eliminate Baylor as a loss to Texas State is nearly unforgivable. If they ran the table and won the Big 12 would that be enough to overcome this stinker of a loss?

#### August 26, 2023 (Week 0)

*(7 Teams Eliminated, 11 Total Eliminated)*

This week we say "good-bye" to: **San Jose State**, **Navy**, **UTEP**, **New Mexico State**, **Ohio**, **FIU**, and **Hawaii**. Gone, but not forgotten...

#### Preseason 2023

*(4 Teams Eliminated, 4 Total Eliminated)*

Each week we'll update the graphic on the home page to reflect the "elimination" of teams from the College Football Playoff (CFP) race. For four teams, the race was over before it even started. In late August, **Arizona State** announced that it was self-imposing a bowl ban for the 2023 season. Given how bad Arizona State has been in recent years, this hardly seems like punishment (were they going to make a bowl game anyway?). They start the season eliminated.

Three teams are in transition from the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) to the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). **James Madison** is in its second and final year of this transition. There are some condition under which the Dukes could make a bowl game, but their journey to the 2023 CFP is over before it even has a chance to begin. **Sam Houston State** and **Jacksonville State** are in their first year of the transition process. They are also out of the CFP race.
