title: "Weekly Analysis"

Here we will provide a weekly description of the thought process behind any playoff eliminations.

**Week 11**

*Cincinnati, Iowa, Minnesota, Syracuse, and Texas Tech\
*(5 teams eliminated)\
(107 total eliminated)

Five more Power 4 teams are eliminated this week. We are down to only 27 teams with viable paths to the College Football Playoff. For some contrast, last year at this point only 9 teams remained in the hunt for the four-team playoff.

**Week 10**

*Navy, Memphis, Virginia Tech, Wake Forest, Duke, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Vanderbilt, Florida, Arkansas, TCU\
*(12 teams eliminated)\
(102 total eliminated)

The defending champions see their (already faint) hopes of a repeat snuffed out this week as more Power 4 teams are eliminated. Group of 5 teams Navy and Memphis see their dreams dashed. There are a hodgepodge of Power 4 teams with three losses that remain (in some way) in the race for their conference championship. It's a bit tough to decide what to do with them, but it seems increasingly unlikely that they will be able to work their way into the playoff picture.

The Group of 5 race for the playoffs is down to: Army, Boise State, Louisiana, and Washington State. Boise State is in the driver's seat here with Army not far behind. It'll be interesting to see the distance between these two teams in the first College Football Playoff poll (released on November 5th). Army has played a weak schedule, but has a chance to earn a statement win on November 23rd against Notre Dame. Even that might not be enough to propel them ahead of Boise State.

**Weeks 8 and 9**

*Georgia Tech, Virginia, Boston College, Stanford, West Virginia, Houston, Arizona, Utah, UCF, Oklahoma State, Nebraska, Michigan State, Washington, Maryland, Rutgers, Liberty, UNLV, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Kentucky, James Madison, UL Monroe, Northwestern, USC, North Texas\
*(25 teams eliminated)\
(90 total eliminated)

More travel and a bout with COVID put me a bit behind on this update, so I'll combine the updates for Week 8 and 9.

The list of Group of 5 teams with a shot at the playoff continues to dwindle as the last Conference USA team (Liberty) is eliminated with a shock loss to Kennesaw State. A whole host of Power 4 teams also see their playoff dreams evaporate. We're entering crunch time with lots of "elimination" games on tap in the next few weeks. The first official College Football Playoff rankings will be released on Tuesday, November 5th (certainly the most notable event taking place that day).

**Weeks 6 and 7**

*Florida State, California, NC State, North Carolina, Baylor, Kansas, Purdue, UCLA, Sam Houston, Toledo, Eastern Michigan, San Jose State, Oregon State, Mississippi State, Auburn, Coastal Carolina*\
(16 teams eliminated)\
(65 total eliminated)

I was out-of-town last week for work, so I'll combine the updates for Weeks 6 and 7.

At last! We say goodbye to several Power 4 conference teams! While several of these teams have long been eliminated from at-large contention, they still had some of a path to the playoff by winning their conference and being a top five conference champion. Those days have now passed. It might be worth taking a moment to see which Group of 5 teams have a path to the playoff. The list grows shorter by the day: Army, Navy, North Texas, Memphis, Liberty, Boise State, UNLV, Washington State (we'll consider them as an Independent for this purpose), James Madison, UL Monroe, and Louisiana. Boise State is currently the highest ranked Group of 5 team with Army and Navy not far behind.\

**Week 5**

*Western Kentucky, Buffalo, Northern Illinois, Fresno State, Georgia State, Texas State\
*(6 teams eliminated)\
(49 total eliminated)

We are oh so close to eliminating our first Power 4 conference teams. Teams like Florida State, Kansas, Houston, and Mississippi State are walking on thin ice and the ice is cracking beneath their feet. Why not eliminate them now? I'm taking a cautious approach to not eliminate Power 4 teams until they are mathematically incapable to winning their conference. I may need to adjust this approach in the future, but we'll keep it for now to be consistent.

**Week 4**

*East Carolina, South Florida, Louisiana Tech, Ball State, Ohio, Bowling Green, Georgia Southern, Marshall, Appalachian State, Arkansas State\
*(10 teams eliminated)\
(43 total eliminated)\
\
We continue saying "Goodbye!" to a variety of Group of 5 teams that hit the two loss threshold. We are getting ever closer to being Power 4 teams joining the ranks of the eliminated. Once a Power 4 team falls far enough back to be eliminated from conference championship contention, we can safely cast them aside. For some teams (even pretty bad teams) this may take awhile.

**Week 3**

*Rice, Tulane, Tulsa, UAB, UTSA, New Mexico State, Middle Tennessee, Florida International, UConn, Miami (OH), Central Michigan, Air Force, Colorado State, Hawai'i, San Diego State, Utah State, Southern Miss\
*(17 teams eliminated)\
(33 total eliminated)

This week we bid farewell to another set of Group of 5 teams as they pass over the bridge to two losses. While these teams could, technically, still win their conference, it seems unlikely that there would not be a better Group of 5 champion ranked above them. What about three loss Power 4 teams (e.g., Florida State)? These teams have not been mathematically eliminated from conference championship contention. However, as these teams compile more and more losses it seems exceedingly likely that, even if they won their conference, that a Group of 5 conference champion could pass them. Recall that no conference (not even the SEC and Big Ten) have an automatic berth in the playoff. Rather, the top five conference champions (from any conference) gain automatic entry into the playoff.

#### Week 2

*Charlotte, Florida Atlantic, Temple, Jacksonville State, UTEP, Massachusetts, Akron, Kent State, Western Michigan, New Mexico, Wyoming, Nevada, Old Dominion, South Alabama, Troy*\
(15 teams eliminated)\
(16 total eliminated)

The culling begins. It seems incredibly unlikely that the committee will award at-large bids to two loss non-Power 4 teams. Several teams hit this two loss threshold this week. UMass is an interesting case with both Missouri and Georgia left on the schedule. Would winning out and winning those two big games be enough? Probably not.

#### Weeks 0 and 1

*Kennesaw State* *\
*(1 team eliminated)\
(1 total eliminated)

This week we say goodbye to the Football Subdivision's newest member, Kennesaw State. As we noted in the Preseason analysis, Kennesaw is not eligible to win the Conference USA title. Their only path to the College Football Playoff would have been via an at-large berth (given to the top seven non-conference champions). The Owls Week 1 loss to UTSA ends those hopes.

A few other teams are teetering on the edge of the precipice (I'm looking at you New Mexico, UMass, and UConn). One more loss for UMass and UConn should send them sliding over the edge.

#### Preseason 2024

*(No Teams Eliminated)*

Each week we'll update the graphic on the home page to reflect the "elimination" of teams from the College Football Playoff (CFP) race.

I was ready to eliminate Kennesaw State (the newest member of the Football Bowl Subdivision) as new teams are typically ineligible for the postseason (with some exceptions) due to their transition period. While Kennesaw is bowl-eligible (if there are not enough teams available to fill the available bowl slots), Kennesaw is not eligible to win the Conference USA title. This precludes them from being a potential automatic CFP qualifier.

CFP spots are available to the five highest-ranked conference champions. Presumably, this will be the four power conference champions (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, and SEC) plus the highest ranked Group of Five champion. Kennesaw State's only path (highly implausible, but not completely impossible) is to be selected as one of the seven at-large teams. We'll leave Kennesaw State as a "not eliminated" team for the moment, but a single loss will be enough to remove them from contention.
