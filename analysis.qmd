Here we will provide a weekly description of the thought process behind any playoff eliminations.

#### Preseason 2024

*(No Teams Eliminated)*

Each week we'll update the graphic on the home page to reflect the "elimination" of teams from the College Football Playoff (CFP) race. I was ready to eliminate Kennesaw State (the newest member of the Football Bowl Subdivision) as new teams are typically ineligible for the postseason (with some exceptions) due to their transition period. However, Kennesaw served their transition time as a Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) team. They are (apparently) fully-eligible.
