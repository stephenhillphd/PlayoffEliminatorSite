title: "Weekly Analysis"

Here we will provide a weekly description of the thought process behind any playoff eliminations.

#### Weeks 0 and 1

* Kennesaw State*
* 1 team eliminated (1 total eliminated)*

This week we say goodbye to the Football Subdivision's newest member, Kennesaw State. As we noted in the Preseason analysis, Kennesaw is not eligible to win the Conference USA title. Their only path to the College Football Playoff would have been via an at-large berth (given to the top seven non-conference champions). The Owls Week 1 loss to UTSA ends those hopes.

A few other teams are teetering on the edge of the precipice (I'm looking at you New Mexico, UMass, and UConn). One more loss for UMass and UConn should send them sliding over the edge. 

#### Preseason 2024

*(No Teams Eliminated)*

Each week we'll update the graphic on the home page to reflect the "elimination" of teams from the College Football Playoff (CFP) race. 

I was ready to eliminate Kennesaw State (the newest member of the Football Bowl Subdivision) as new teams are typically ineligible for the postseason (with some exceptions) due to their transition period. While Kennesaw is bowl-eligible (if there are not enough teams available to fill the available bowl slots), Kennesaw is not eligible to win the Conference USA title. This precludes them from being a potential automatic CFP qualifier. 

CFP spots are available to the five highest-ranked conference champions. Presumably, this will be the four power conference champions (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, and SEC) plus the highest ranked Group of Five champion. Kennesaw State's only path (highly implausible, but not completely impossible) is to be selected as one of the seven at-large teams. We'll leave Kennesaw State as a "not eliminated" team for the moment, but a single loss will be enough to remove them from contention.
